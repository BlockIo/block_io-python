# Relevant dTrust API calls (Numbers 1 thru 7: they work the same way as their non-dTrust counterparts on https://block.io/api).
# For a list of parameters and how to use these calls, please refer to their equivalent counterparts at https://block.io/api
# For any help whatsoever, please reach support@block.io
# 1. get_dtrust_address_balance
# 2. get_dtrust_address_by_label
# 3. get_my_dtrust_addresses
# 4. get_new_dtrust_address -- as demonstrated above
# 5. get_dtrust_transactions
# 6. withdraw_from_dtrust_labels -- returns an object with data to sign, and the public keys of the private keys that need to sign them. Does not accept a PIN -- it's of no use in dTrust withdrawals.
# 7. withdraw_from_dtrust_addresses -- same as (6)
# 8. sign_and_finalize_withdrawal (signature_data is a JSON string) -- you can use this call to finalize the transaction and sign it in one API call if needed
#    for the nitty gritty on this call, see https://block.io/api/simple/signing
#
# Distributed Trust-only calls:
# Number 9 and 10 do not need an API Key
# 9. get_remaining_signers* (parameter: reference_id) -- tells you the public keys that are yet to sign the transaction
# 10. sign_transaction* (signature_data is a JSON string) -- as demonstrated above
# 11. finalize_transaction* -- as demonstrated above
#   
#    API Calls marked with * are specific to the Distributed Trust framework.

# end :)
